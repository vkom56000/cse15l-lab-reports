step 6: 
  cd lab7
  ```<Ctrl + v>``` 
  ```<Ctrl + v>``` T```<tab><backspace>```
  
  The ctrl v keyboard shortcut helped me copy the compiler command and the run command from the previos labs. 
  I had to type out the file to run and I used the tab key to auto finish the file and the extension so that I don't have to type it out.

        ```<Ctrl + x>```
        ```<y>```
        ```<enter>```
